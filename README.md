# Info 201 Group Project

### Final Set of Research Questions

1. Analyze the cost of college by location (i.e. grouping by zip code). Filter further by in-state vs. out-of-state tuition.
2. What colleges have the highest post-college average earnings depending on Public, Private Nonprofit, and Private For-Profit colleges?
3. What colleges have the best repayment rate (for 1, 3, 5, and 7 years) based on family income?
4. Which schools have the greatest cumulative median debt disaggregated by student subgroups?

### Proposal Feedback

Great topic! Sounds like an interesting project.

You need to be careful in your first question: there may be multiple variables affecting post-college average earnings, such as major.  A college may have more liberal arts students who get lower pay and therefore lower the college's average, but may have a really good "bang for your buck" for STEM students. You'll need to propose a way to handle this.

Something that might be interesting to analyze is cost variables by location (i.e. grouping by zip code).

### Project Requirements

What exactly you build is up to your group, but it must meet the following requirements:

* Create an interactive platform using R (i.e. a Shiny web app)
* Choose a dataset of sufficient complexity to explore. This doesn't mean it has to be Big Data, but it should either be of notable size (more than a few hundred observations), or complexity (more than ~5 features of each observation)
* Demonstrate a nuanced understanding of the important features of the dataset.  High-level insights (important descriptive information, major trends, notable outliers, etc.) should be prominent in your resource.  Statistical analyses may be included if appropriate
* Devise a visual representation of your data (i.e., chart, map, etc.).  Ideally, this should be an interactive visualization with ability to interact with the interface (hover, click, drag, etc.), or change the data being displayed (i.e., the chart responds to a set of controls, such as which data is being displayed)
* Tailor your resource to a specific target audience.  The way you frame your solution for a scientific versus general audience is quite different
