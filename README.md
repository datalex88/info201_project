### College Compare

In this Shiny App, we use a data set from [College Scorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/) which contains data where we are able to inform a potential user to help make a decsion when looking at which university to pick. When filtering through this data, we found four areas of interest that would be particularly helpful to either a high school student looking at different colleges or that of the parent of the said student.  Some things that will interest them most have to do with costs, post-education debts and of course what they might expect to earn.  We utilized a data set from 2012-2013 to extract pertinent data to answer the following questions:

1. Analyze the cost of college by state. Filter further by in-state vs. out-of-state tuition.
2. What colleges have the highest post-college average earnings depending on Public, Private Nonprofit, and Private For-Profit colleges?
3. What colleges have the best repayment rate (for 1, 3, 5, and 7 years) based on family income?
4. Which schools have the greatest cumulative median debt disaggregated by income groups?
